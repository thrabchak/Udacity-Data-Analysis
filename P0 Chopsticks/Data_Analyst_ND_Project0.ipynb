    "\n",
    "A few researchers set out to determine the optimal length of chopsticks for children and adults. They came up with a measure of how effective a pair of chopsticks performed, called the \"Food Pinching Performance.\" The \"Food Pinching Performance\" was determined by counting the number of peanuts picked and placed in a cup (PPPC).\n",

    "*the abstract below was adapted from the link*\n",

    "Chopsticks are one of the most simple and popular hand tools ever invented by humans, but have not previously been investigated by [ergonomists](https://www.google.com/search?q=ergonomists). Two laboratory studies were conducted in this research, using a [randomised complete block design](http://dawg.utk.edu/glossary/whatis_rcbd.htm), to evaluate the effects of the length of the chopsticks on the food-serving performance of adults and children. Thirty-one male junior college students and 21 primary school pupils served as subjects for the experiment to test chopsticks lengths of 180, 210, 240, 270, 300, and 330 mm. The results showed that the food-pinching performance was significantly affected by the length of the chopsticks, and that chopsticks of about 240 and 180 mm long were optimal for adults and pupils, respectively. Based on these findings, the researchers suggested that families with children should provide both 240 and 180 mm long chopsticks. In addition, restaurants could provide 210 mm long chopsticks, considering the trade-offs between ergonomics and cost.\n",

    "\n",
    "The scatter plot seems to show that in the adult population the chopsticks closer in length to 240mm generally perform better than chopsticks that are farther in length from 240mm. There is an exception (outlier) to this generalization when chopstick length is 270mm. The PPPC of 270mm chopsticks is lower than expected in this relationship. \n",

    "This relationship could be better shown with more samples in the length of chopsticks used. Instead of using chopstick lengths of every 20mm, choosing chopstick lengths of every 10mm would improve the resolution of the scatterplot which may lead to a better understanding of the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.\n"

    "### In the abstract the researchers stated that their results showed food-pinching performance was significantly affected by the length of the chopsticks, and that chopsticks of about 240 mm long were optimal for adults.\n",

    "However, I am skeptical of the significance of their conclusion on the effect of chopstick length on the practical use of chopsticks. Food Pinching Performance measured by the number of peanuts picked up and placed in a cup is a very specific motion with a very specific food, however eating contains motions other than picking up and placing peanuts in a cup. Because peanuts are so small, this experiment did not consider the handling of bigger foods by using PPPC. Peanuts are also relatively round, PPPC does not take into account irregular shaped food. Also, PPPC does not actually ever involve the user of the chopsticks placing the food in their mouth, perhaps this is a key element to chopstick performance that was not taken into account in this experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "If all eating was the same as picking up peanuts and placing it in a cup than I would say this controlled experiment represented eating well. However it would seem to me that eating is more complicated than PPPC suggests. The significance of this study would be more substantial if it took additional variables into account. Those variables could include different types of food or different eating motions. \n"
