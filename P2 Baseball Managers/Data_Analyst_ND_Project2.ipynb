    "### Introduction\n",
    "Major League Baseball (MLB) is known for its all-stars making multi million dollar salaries and hitting towering homeruns. Often overlooked is the manager, who rarely leaves the duggout except to argue with an umpire, throw his hat, and get ejected from the game. Some managers are well known, have winning teams, and make it into the hall of fame, many others are forgotten by fans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the scenes there are many decisions being made by the manager every pitch, such as the positioning of fielders, preparation of a relief pitcher, or if the batter should try to bunt. These decisions do affect the outcome of the game and cumulatively the season. However, the results of managerial decisions manifest themselves in the performance of the players which makes directly measuring the performance of the manager difficult. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, managers have responsibilities that are unrelated to or indirectly related to winning games, such as interacting with the media. This paper will not take into consideration skills which do not affect team statistics, although extraneous, non-baseball related skills are relevant to assessing the overall performance of managers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "Methods for assessing the performance of baseball managers have been proposed in several academic papers. The most popular method is James's (1986) \"Pythagorean theorem\", in which a manager's performance is assessed using an estimation of expected wins. Additionally, Bradbury (2006) assesses a manager in terms of impact on player performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2014, Randy Silvers and Raul Susmel explored the compensation of managers in their paper \"Compensation of a Manager: The Case of Major League Baseball\". Instead of attempting to directly assess the performance of a manager using a metric derived from baseball statistics, they hypothesized that the economic market of baseball managers would result in the best performing managers (highest team winning percentage and number of playoff appearances) being compensated the highest salaries. The results of their analysis showed that a manager's past performance affects the manager's current salary, but the manager's current salary does not affect the current performance of the manager's team. Silvers and Susmel note that in efficient markets the compensation of a manager is a sufficient measure of his expected productivity but in this case has been shown to be insignificant in predicting any team performance metric. This implies that the market of MLB managers is not efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on Silvers and Susmel and the previous papers, it seems as if there is still room for improvement in understanding the role of an MLB manager and the impact they have on the performance of their team."

    "### Questions\n",
    "There are many possible questions about MLB managers, assesing their performance, and assessing their impact on their team. To limit the scope of this paper, only the following question will be explored:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When a manager transfers teams, does the relative performance of any team statistic from the manager's previous team transfer to the manager's new team?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Alternative Questions\n",
    "Below are other questions which I considered addressing in this paper. However they need further refinement in order to be actionable.\n",
    "- How important is having a good manager to the success of a major league baseball team?\n",
    "- Which, if any, team statistics correlate with the winningest managers?\n",
    "- What are characteristics of managers that make it into the hall of fame?\n",
    "- What are characteristics of managers that have short careers?\n",
    "- Are any managers particularly good in the post season?\n",
    "- Do any team statistics correlate with a long managerial career?\n",
    "- Who is the most recent player manager and what were the circumstances?\n",
    "- Are there any trends in the salaries of managers?\n",
    "- Has a 'bad' manager ever won the world series? In other words, has a team performed so well as to compensate for having a less than ideal manager?"

    "### Wrangle\n",
    "The data for this project comes from the 2014 edition of The Lahman Baseball Database. We will need to refine the data from this source to better address our question.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lahman Baseball Database contains all the required information necessary for this project in the Teams and Managers tables. However we will need to transform the data into new tables in order to make the data more accessible for our exploration and analysis. We first determine the relative performance for each team statistic for each year and append the values as columns to the existing Teams table. We then filter the Managers table to only include managers that remained with the same team for the whole year. This is because we are unable to divide up the team statistics table into segments attributable to different managers within the same season. We then create a new table containing manager stints, in which a stint is a collection of consecutive seasons a manager remained with the same team (and lasted the full year). We then create functions which help describe the relative performances of each statistic in each stint. We can then create a table of manager transitions, in which a manger transfers from a stint on one team to a stint on another. Finally we create functions which produce descriptive statistics comparing the relative performance of a statistic in the before stint to the relative performance of the same statistic in the after stint.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of missing data, the Teams table is incomplete for every row. Notably it is missing team statistics from the columns SB, CS, HBP, SF, and DP. In this paper, we will not look at these team statistics because it would introduce error if we compared years in which these statistics were recordered and years in which they were not recorded. For the Managers table, we select only managers which fulfill all the required criteria in our filtering of Managers step (step 3). This means that in our output, we are certain that we have all the required information that we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an overview, below is a summary of the steps we will take in the data wrangling phase.\n",
    "1. Import relevant data from The Lahman Baseball Database.\n",
    "2. Appened relative performance (rank) for each team statistic for each year to teams_df.\n",
    "3. Filter mangers_df to only include managers that lasted the full year.\n",
    "4. Create table of manager stints.\n",
    "5. Aggregate the relative performance of each team statistic for each stint.\n",
    "6. Create table containing manager stint transitions.\n",
    "7. Append the differences of each statistic created in step 5 to the table of manager stint transitions (created in step 6)."

    "We want to append the relative statistical performance of teams to the existing teams_df DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative statistical perfomance is a team's performance for a given statistic in respect to all other teams for that year. For example, the team with the most wins in a given year performed the best for that statistic (\"W\") and would be given a relative statistical performance (\"rel_W\") of 1. The team with the second most wins would be given a 2. If two teams have the same value for a given statistic, they will share the same value for relative statistical performance. For example if two teams shared the same number of wins, and that number of wins was the most for that season, both teams would share the relative statistical performance of 1. In this case, the team with the next most number of wins would be given a relative statistical performance of 3, because 2 other teams performed better. The team_stat dictionary contains the information for how a statistic should be ordered, either largest to smallest (True) or smallest to largest (False)."

    "#### 6. Manager Transitions\n",

    "We limit the transitions with the following conditions: \n",
    "- There must be a before and after stint (there is not a transition from before a manger's career to the manager's first stint, likewise for the end of the manager's career).

    "Now that we have our data organized, we are ready to start looking for patterns in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our starting question was: When a manager transfers teams, does the relative performance of any team statistic from the manager's previous team transfer to the manager's new team?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we can modify step 7 so that we test for a significant statistical difference in each relative statistic between the before and after stints for each transition. Normally, we would use a t test to do this, however we are not certain that our data is normally distributed, which is required for an independent samples t test. Instead we can use the Wilcoxon rank sum test, which produces a t statistic and p value for non parametric data. Similar to a t test, if the returned p value is less than the chosen alpha, we can say that the mean difference of the two sets differed significantly. We can then generate a list of stats for each transition in which the statistics differ significantly between the before and after stints in the transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "However this approach only answers our question of which statistics transfer along with the manager in a roundabout way. The results would show which statistics did not transfer between teams, which has some valuable meaning, but does not show which statistics do transfer between teams. \n",
    "\n",
    "It would also be appropriate to test the reverse, answering the question of which statistics stay significantly the same between the before and after stint for a transition. As presented by Harvey Molusky, one way to test for equivalence is by comparing the 95% confidence intervals of the two sets. If both 95% confidence intervals fall below a given threshold, they are considered the same. In our case, we will choose the threshold to be 1 because we are comparing the relative placement of statistics, in which a difference of less than 1 would not occur in any given year (unless they have the same place, in which case they are truly equivalent). Because we cannot assume the data sets are normally distributed, determining the confidence interval becomes more difficult. In order to create a confidence interval for this non-normally distributed data, we use bootstrapping as defined in (Scheiner, Gurevitch, 1999) and implemented in the scikit-bootstrap python library.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative approach to equivalency testing with non parametric data is defined in Meier (2010) in which a Wilcoxon sum rank test is used in substitution for the independent samples t test in a TOST (two one-sided t) equivalency test. This approach will not be explored in this paper but it would be interesting to compare the results generated with this approach against the results generated from the confidence interval approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, using the output DataFrame of step 7 which includes the difference in performance for each stat for each transition, we can look for overall trends between team statistics."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "In our first area of exploration, we sought to answer the question of which team statistics differed significantly between stints during a transition. This question is scoped for a single transition. The results can then be aggregated over all transitions and we can search for trends in the number of occurrences of each team statistic being significantly different between stints.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each statistic for each transition, we ran a Wilcoxon rank sum test (alpha=0.05) to test for a significant difference between the relative performance of the chosen team statistic between the two stints in the transition. We used the Wilcoxon rank sum test instead of an independent samples t test because we could not assume that the set of relative performances of a team statistic for a given stint were normally distributed. In our Wilcoxon rank sum test, we took our null hypothesis to be that the mean difference in relative performance for a team statistic between the before and after stints was equal to 0. The alternative hypothesis is that the difference in relative performance for a team statistic between the before and after stints was not equal to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results showed that each transition had it's own unique set of team statistics that differed significantly. No team statistic significantly differed in every transition. When the results were aggregated over all transitions, we saw that the team's relative number of HR and SOA significantly differed the most often during a transition, albeit this does not seem to be a strong trend because significant difference in relative performance of HR and SOA only occurred in 13 of the potential 28 transitions (46.4%).\n",
    "\n",
    "In our second area of exploration, we sought to answer the question of which team statistics remained significantly the same between stints during a transition. This question is not simply the opposite of the first area of exploration because failing to reject the null hypothesis does not imply that the null hypothesis is correct. Instead, we tested for equivalency by comparing the 95% confidence interval for both the relative performance of a team statistic before the transition and the relative performance of a team statistic after the transition. We found the midpoint of the centers of the two confidence intervals and applied half the tolerance in the positive and negative directions to create our zone of indifference. If both confidence intervals fell within the zone of indifference, we took the results to be equivalent. We chose the tolerance to be 1 because (individually) ranks are integer based and two ranks within 1 would imply equality. Determining a confidence interval for the relative performance for a statistic in a stint is not trivial because the data is not necessarily normally distributed. In order to create a 95% confidence interval, we bootstrapped (sampling with replacement, n=10,000) each statistic for both stints for each transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results returned no team statistics that remained significantly equivalent between the before and after stints of a transition, given the chosen tolerance. This could be attributed in part to the small sets of data, considering that the overall average manager stint duration is only 2 years (in our exploration we only look at transitions in which both stint durations are at least 3 years). As we increase the equivalency tolerance, the number of equivalent statistics increases as can be shown in the appendix on the graph \"The effect of threshold on percentage of team statistic occurrences when testing for relative statistic performance equivalence between stints\". However, the equivalency results are less meaningful when the tolerance is increased beyond the chosen threshold. Given our results in this area of exploration, it seems unlikely that any manager's relative performance of any particular team statistic will carry over to the new stint.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our third area of exploration, we looked for trends in overall differences between the before and after stints. To do this, we found the means of the mean difference in relative performance between the before and after stint for every statistic for every transition. In general it appears that the data is negatively skewed with 1 outlier in the negative direction. The results show that on average the difference in relative performance is positive, meaning that the relative performance of the statistic was worse in the second stint than in the first stint.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Areas for further research\n",
    "After completing this paper there are two areas of exploration that can expand upon our results. The first would be to better understand the distribution of relative performance of each statistic for a given stint. This would potentially allow us to use a different test other than the Wilcoxon rank sum test for determining significant differences in performance. Likewise, it might allow for easier computation of a TOST test for determining equivalency between stint statistical performance. Perhaps using alternative tests would produce stronger, more refined results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, our third area of exploration brought about the question of whether or not it is better to hire first time managers vs veteran managers with a transition history. In our paper, we only looked at managers which transitioned from one team to another and did not look at first time managers. With most team statistics performing on average worse in the second stint than the first, perhaps it is better to start with a new manager rather than one which on average will worsen team statistics."
